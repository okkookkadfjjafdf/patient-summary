She was in her usual state of good health until one week prior to admission when she noticed the abrupt onset of chest pain, which she describes as dull and aching in character. The pain began in the left para-sternal area and radiated up to her neck. She has had 3 episodes of pain since the initial onset, with the most recent episode lasting 30 minutes and prompting her visit to the Emergency Department.",

Lisinopril, as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is prescribed to reduce systemic vascular resistance via vasodilation, with the therapeutic goal of lowering blood pressure to target levels, thus reducing the risk of hypertensive cardiovascular complications.",
        "Metoprolol succinate 50 mg extended-release orally once daily: Indicated for angina pectoris and blood pressure control. This selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker is intended to decrease myocardial oxygen demand by lowering heart rate and contractility, thereby providing symptomatic relief from anginal episodes and contributing to the long-term management of ischemic heart disease.",
        "Atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily at bedtime: Prescribed for dyslipidemia with a family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD). This HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is aimed at reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis, leading to an increase in the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a resultant decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. The goal is the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by mitigating hypercholesterolemia."
